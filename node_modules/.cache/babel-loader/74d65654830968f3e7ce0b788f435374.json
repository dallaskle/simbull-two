Currently, trading fees are $1 per trade.'},{Q:'How do I make money?',N:9,A:'There are two ways to make money on SimBull: Win Payouts and share price appreciation. Users who own virtual shares are eligible for payouts when a team they own wins an event. NFL payouts are $.50 per share, per team win and NBA shares are $.10 per share, per team win. There are no limits on payouts so the more virtual shares you own the more you have the chance to earn. The other way to make money is buy low and sell high.

We have strict rules on introducing new virtual shares, so we do not diminish the value of the current virtual shares.'},{Q:'How are the prices set?',N:14,A:'SimBull will release initial share offering (ISO) shares to our user base in order to launch a new league.
