Each virtual share of team stock represents a mini team pennant. We are NOT a gambling website. The physical asset allows our market to operate as an exchange because users are buying and selling a physical asset and not wagering on a specific event. At any given time, you can submit your virtual share to SimBull and we will send you the pennant that is backing your virtual share. Owning virtual shares will also entitle you to receive payouts when a team you own wins an event. If you choose to submit your share to SimBull for the pennant you will lose your entitlement to future payouts. Most players will never submit their share for the pennant because of the future cash payouts for each share.'\n  }, {\n    Q: 'What are payouts?',\n    N: 2,\n    A: 'Payouts will be deposited into your account after a team you own wins a game. There is no limit on payouts so the more virtual shares (i.e. pennants) you own, the more payouts you will receive. Payouts will be paid out at the conclusion of an event so make sure to not trade your virtual shares before the payouts are deposited into your account. Payouts for the NFL will be $.50 per share, per team win. Payouts will continue to be paid out for playoffs wins so make sure to take that into account when valuing a team. '\n  }, {\n    Q: 'Is this gambling?',\n    N: 3,\n    A: 'No, this is completely legal in all 50 states because SimBull is an exchange. Similar to Ebay or Craigslist, users are buying a physical asset backing the virtual share. SimBull holds the asset on your behalf until you choose to submit the virtual share and receive the physical asset. Most users will not take possession of the asset because of the future cash payouts available to users. The asset also gives users confidence that their investment has value outside the SimBull platform.'\n  }, {\n    Q: 'How do I deposit money?',\n    N: 4,\n    A: 'Go to the Accounts > Transfers > Add Cash and then select your preferred deposit method. SimBull uses PayPal to accept cash transfers and credit card transactions. '\n  }, {\n    Q: 'How do I withdraw money?',\n    N: 5,\n    A: 'Go to Accounts > Transfers > Request Your Money and then enter your withdraw amount. SimBull uses PayPal send money to you so enter the email that is attached to your PayPal account. Once we verify your request in 2-4 business days, we will transfer the money into your PayPal account.'\n  }, {\n    Q: 'How do I request my team pennant?',\n    N: 6,\n    A: 'Go to Accounts > Transfers > Request your Pennant and then select the share. Once we verify the request, we will mail the pennant and you will receive it in 5-7 business days. '\n  }, {\n    Q: 'How do I refer friends?',\n    N: 7,\n    A: 'When your friends make an account, make sure they deposit cash and list your full name as their referral when they complete their profile. Once you refer 5 new users and they make a cash deposit we will deposit a free share into your account. '\n  }, {\n    Q: 'Are there trading fees?',\n    N: 8,\n    A: 'Yes, trading fees fund the payouts. Currently, trading fees are $1 per trade.'\n  }, {\n    Q: 'How do I make money?',\n    N: 9,\n    A: 'There are two ways to make money in the SimBull Exchange: Payouts and share price appreciation. Users who own virtual shares are eligible for payouts when a team they own wins an event. NFL payouts are $.50 per share, per team win. There are no limits on payouts so the more virtual shares you own the more you will earn. The other way to make money is buy low and sell high. If you believe a team will be good in the future, you can buy the team for cheap and when people value the team higher you can sell your virtual shares to earn a profit.'\n  }, {\n    Q: 'Can I earn payouts after I take possession of my pennant?',\n    N: 10,\n    A: 'No, once the virtual share is submitted to SimBull, that virtual share is no longer eligible for future payouts. '\n  }, {\n    Q: 'Do I have to report my earnings to the IRS?',\n    N: 11,\n    A: 'Please see this article from TurboTax for a detailed description: https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/self-employment-taxes/a-tax-filing-factsheet-for-ebay-sellers/L7h6uJr0i'\n  }, {\n    Q: 'Can I create my own shares and sell them on SimBull?',\n    N: 12,\n    A: 'No, SimBull is a closed market meaning that SimBull will supply all shares sold on the website. We do this to maintain proper supply and demand so the value of virtual shares are not diminished or artificially increased for the first users. SimBull has a formula for when to introduce more shares into the market so shares will not be diminished due to increased supply or demand.'\n  }, {\n    Q: 'Do all teams have the same number of shares?',\n    N: 13,\n    A: 'Yes, each team in the same league will have the same exact number of shares. League to league share numbers depend on the trading volume in the league.'\n  }, {\n    Q: 'How many shares are there for each team in a league?',\n    N: 14,\n    A: 'SimBull has a metric to determine the number of virtual shares necessary to create the proper supply and demand. The 2020 NFL season will see 20 shares introduced into the market for each team. That number may increase throughout the season as demand increases. We have strict rules on introducing new virtual shares, so we do not diminish the value of the current virtual shares.'\n  }, {\n    Q: 'How are the prices set?',\n    N: 15,\n    A: 'After the initial offering of virtual shares, SimBull does NOT manipulate the market and prices are set by supply and demand of each share. SimBull is a free market and all prices are determined by the users in the market. The only time SimBull will affect market price is by introducing more shares into the market, but those cases will be rare and used only to bring the market back to the proper supply of shares.'\n  }, {\n    Q: 'How are the prices of initial offerings of virtual shares created?',\n    N: 16,\n    A: 'SimBull has a formula that takes into account the present value of future payouts to set the prices for the initial offering. After that, prices are determined by the free market.'\n  }, {\n    Q: 'How are additional shares released into the market?',\n    N: 17,\n    A: 'SimBull will periodically release new virtual shares into the marketplace when demand for virtual shares increases. The new virtual shares will appear as open ask orders and the prices will be equal to the lowest ask order. For example, if for Team A, there are ask orders of $6, $8, and $10, the new virtual shares will take the value of $6. Users who are trying to sell their virtual shares will be given priority in the market over new shares. For example, if a user is trying to sell 2 shares of team A for $6 and there are 2 new shares of team A for $6, the user’s shares will be executed first, if a bid order meets the price. If there are no ask orders for a team, the new virtual share prices will be equal to the last executed trade price for that team.'\n  }, {\n    Q: 'Can I trade virtual shares during games?',\n    N: 18,\n    A: 'Yes, trading is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Keep in mind, the user who owns the virtual share at the end of a game receives the payout. How long will it take to receive the pennant if I choose to submit my virtual shares? SimBull will ship the pennant once we receive a notification that a user has requested a pennant. The virtual share will be taken from the users account and the pennant will ship in 5-7 business days.'\n  }, {\n    Q: 'Is SimBull a Zero-Sum Game?',\n    N: 19,\n    A: 'A Zero-Sum Game means that the total value of all shares in the market is constant at all time. Meaning, if one team increases in value then another team decreases in value. SimBull is a free market and the value of virtual shares is determined by supply and demand. The value of the market may be higher at certain times and lower at others. SimBull is not a “Zero-Sum Game”, but rather a free market with the possibility of payouts.'\n  }];\n  return /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n    className: \"FAQs robo400\",\n    children:
