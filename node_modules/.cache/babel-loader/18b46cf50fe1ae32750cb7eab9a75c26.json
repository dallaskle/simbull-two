Win payouts are not guaranteed and win payouts are made at the discretion of SimBull. Ownership of a team pennant represented by a virtual share gives the user the right to the team pennant backing their share and nothing else. All win payouts are optional and voluntary for SimBull. Win payouts are not made by any triggering event, game, or event outside the control of SimBull. All win payouts are at the discretion of SimBull and may be suspended or cancelled at any time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n        <p>If the user has the right to a team pennant represented by a virtual share, at any time they may ask for the delivery of the team pennant. SimBull will verify the validity of the ownership claim and will deliver the team pennant in a reasonable amount of time once a request has been made. At the time of the request, the virtual share representing the team pennant will be destroyed and the user will no longer have the right to the virtual share, or any win payouts connected to the virtual share. Asking for delivery of the team pennant forfeits any right the user has to a virtual share and any future win payouts that may be made to that virtual share.</p>\r\n        <p><strong>RETURN/REFUNDS</strong><strong>&nbsp;POLICY</strong></p>\r\n        <p>All sales are final and no refund will be issued.</p>\r\n        <p><strong>PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES</strong></p>\r\n        <p>You may not access or use the Site for any purpose other than that for which we make the Site available.

Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.&nbsp;The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in&nbsp;United States,&nbsp;Minnesota. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>\r\n        <p>If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the&nbsp;state and federal courts&nbsp;located in&nbsp;United States,&nbsp;Minnesota, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such&nbsp;state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) is excluded from these Terms of Use.</p>\r\n        <p>If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable, and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>\r\n        <p><strong>Restrictions</strong></p>\r\n        <p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>\r\n        <p><strong>Exceptions to Arbitration</strong></p>\r\n        <p>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>\r\n        <p><strong>CORRECTIONS</strong></p>\r\n        <p>There may be information on the Site that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions that may relate to the Marketplace Offerings, including descriptions, pricing, availability, and various other information.
